- Use your host-based application whitelisting or application firewall to limit Obsidian communications with networking.
- Make the "plugins" folder so that it can only be edited by an admin or the Obsidian app.  I'm not sure how this would be done, but if possible, make it so that only the system/user authorized to run the application or authorized users like system administrators can edit the plugins folder and add new plugins.  They can manage plugins by having an admin vault that they test in and then push out changes to the plugins folder.  This could have lots of issues if not testing and there may be a workflow that has to be done or some sort of JIT (just in time) administration setting that needs to be made.
